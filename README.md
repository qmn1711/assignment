# Assignment

- A simple candidate applications management: listing, sorting, filtering
- Can reuse the `useTable` hook and `VirtualScroller` to build more things (inspired by react-table idea)

## Run

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Notes
- Can't use scss. Node Sass is having some issues with node-sass 6 and my arm64 macOS
- I don't have enough time to cover all cases of re-rendering optimizing, responsive, and typescript types (TODO)
- I run with node `v16.4.0`, npm `7.18.1`
