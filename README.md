## Building

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
Your app is ready to be deployed.

## Testing

```
yarn test
```

Runs Jest to test all files in `src`.


```
yarn test:watch
```

By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

You can run with Jest CLI options. For example:

``` 

## Linting
